# MaskRCNN
This is a project which I am doing for object detection and it shows everything needed to run MaskRCNN from setup and installation to training
MaskRCNN is an extention of Faster R CNN and works better than Faster RCNN, the only change in this is we have to provide our annotations both in the form of masks as well as xml files
