# MaskRCNN
This is a project which I am doing for object detection and it shows everything needed to run MaskRCNN from setup and installation to training
MaskRCNN is an extention of Faster R CNN and works better than Faster RCNN, the only change in this is we have to provide our annotations both in the form of masks as well as xml files 
This project is done using the very well known tensorflow object detection API and hence firstly, what you need to know is how to install tensorflow object detction API,Here is a link how to install and setup tensorflow object detection API
